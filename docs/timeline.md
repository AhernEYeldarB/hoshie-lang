# 03 Nov 2020 Outline Document

A one page document consisting of a short analysis of the project in the students own words and a broad plan of the steps to complete the work. The supervisor should give the pass mark if and only if s/he is convinced that this document demonstrates that the student has understood the FYP.

# 10 Mar 2021 Extended Abstract of the Project Report

A written document of about 5 pages. It must contain a summary of the most important findings of the work undertaken. The format should allow for consistent reading, similar to a journal publication.

The purpose of this stage is to ensure that the student starts to write their final report in a timely fashion. The assessment and feedback should focus on the quality of the document and not on the technical quality of work per se. A pass judgment for this stage should not be construed as a promise that the work as a whole is pass worthy.

# 21 April 2021 Final Project Report

Report writing guidelines were given separately. Upload instructions: Prepare a zip or or tar.gz archive with your report as PDF in the folder root and one sub-folder with all source code you wrote as part of your FYP. If you have any online demonstration then create a file with the name demo.html with clickable links and add it also to the root folder of the archive.
